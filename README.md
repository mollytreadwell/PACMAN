# PACMAN

Watch PacMan chomp his way back and forth across your screen! 

### How Does It Work?

Once the function "Run()" is called within the setInterval method, PacMan's position changes and as it does, one of four images (mouth open facing right, mouth closed facing right, mouth open facing left, mouth closed facing left) are displayed on the screen. The combination of motion and alternating images makes the classic arcade creature appear to be eating his way along your browser.

### But... How Does He Know When Turn Around?

The images alternate between right-facing open and closed mouths as PacMan is moving from left to right and left-facing ones once he has turned around and heads back to the left. This is because the function "checkPageBounds()" notes where the image is in relation to the screen width. 

## Next Up...

The next part of my PacMan plan is to make him move both horizontally AND vertically. This will include extra images (mouth open facing down, mouth closed facing down, mouth open facing up, mouth closed facing up) that will give the project more authenticity to the original game.
